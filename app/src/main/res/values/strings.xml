    <string name="about_us_paragraph">Inspired by the famous words of Rick Astley (you know what
        we\'re talking about), we came up with an idea to create an app that\'ll never give up on
        people.\n\n\"Digiledger\" was designed keeping in mind a good social aim - to create an app
        with an intuitive and straightforward user interface (UI) that helps people keep track of
        simple day to day transactions.\n\n

        Our team:\n
        1) Daksh Gehlot\n
        2) Prathmesh Badgujar\n
        3) Pakhi Gupta\n
        4) Varsha Poswalia\n\nWe see stalls and small shops everywhere. These people may not be as
        educated about keeping a ledger as we are. The app we developed, helps them to properly
        calculate and manage their transactions. This is just the first build of the app, many more
        features are yet to come.\n\nSpecial thanks to "Fanda" and GDSC Shirpur for providing us the
        opportunity to develop
